- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BostonBSD
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Perl, C, BSD, Linux, Latex, Gtk
I like BSD, FreeBSD, NomadBSD, GhostBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS108, etc.

BSD doesn't always have the latest packages, so github allows me to download and compile the latest
packages for my system.

Github also allows for a greater selection of packages.
