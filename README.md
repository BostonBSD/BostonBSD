- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BostonBSD
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Perl, C, BSD, Linux, Latex, Gtk
I like BSD, FreeBSD, NomadBSD, GhostBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS108, etc.

BSD doesn't always have the latest packages, so github allows me to download and compile the latest
packages for my system.

Github also allows for a greater selection of packages.

<!---
BostonBSD/BostonBSD is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

None of my skillset is in balance with the people who violate with the machine that can determine all information.

My skillset was not inflated in balance with the people who violate with the machine that can determine all information..

I am not competing with the people who violate with the machine that can determine all information.

None of my labor can be used to violate anyone with the machine that can determine all information.
