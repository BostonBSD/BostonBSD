- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BostonBSD
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Perl, C, BSD, Linux, Latex, Gtk
I like BSD, FreeBSD, NomadBSD, GhostBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS108, etc.

BSD doesn't always have the latest packages, so github allows me to download and compile the latest
packages for my system.

Github also allows for a greater selection of packages.

However, no one wants velocity to be excessive.

Although, if it were excessive, the g-forces exerted can be neutralized with the 4th, 5th, 6th, etc derivatives of the position graph, thus making a high velocity ride equally as pleasant as a low velocity ride...*
