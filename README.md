- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BostonBSD
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Perl, C, BSD, Linux, Latex, Gtk
I like BSD, FreeBSD, NomadBSD, GhostBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS108, etc.

BSD doesn't always have the latest packages, so github allows me to download and compile the latest
packages for my system.

Github also allows for a greater selection of packages.


-----------------------

Good people have very high negative gratification and very low positive gratification.
[fast elevation, slow reduction]


Bad people have very high positive gratification and very low negative gratification.
[fast reduction, slow elevation]

================

Good people have more positive gratification throughout their lifetime [their reduction lasts longer].

Bad people have more negative gratification throughout their lifetime [their elevation lasts longer].

The victim is the same size as the violator.  

The victim is good, the violator is bad.

[gratification is the same as acceleration in the kinematics equations; stress, desire, and gratification are the same as position, velocity, and acceleration].
