- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BostonBSD
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Perl, C, BSD, Linux, Latex, Gtk
I like BSD, FreeBSD, NomadBSD, GhostBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS108, etc.

BSD doesn't always have the latest packages, so github allows me to download and compile the latest
packages for my system.

Github also allows for a greater selection of packages.

<!---
BostonBSD/BostonBSD is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.

I have never agreed to violate anyone with the machine that can determine all information. 

I am not balancing with people who violate with the machine that can determine all information.

None of my skillset is in balance with the people who violate with the machine that can determine all information.

My skillset was not inflated in balance with the people who violate with the machine that can determine all information..

I am not competing with the people who violate with the machine that can determine all information.

None of my labor can be used to violate anyone with the machine that can determine all information.

It isn't possible to violate anyone with the machine that can determine all information after socializing with me.

-------------------------------------------------

If you're already in violation of someone with the machine that can determine all information you are going to sustain the same stress concentration as your own victim.  You can send me an email immediately [it is what you would not do], telling me that there is a machine that can determine all information, my email is g.isaac.friedman@hotmail.com.  But you wont and I already know this.
